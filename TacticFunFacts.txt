There are three forms of ambushes: anti-armor, point, and area.
            <ul>
                <li>
Anti-armor ambushes focus on debilitating the enemy’s armored vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
Point ambushes deploy soldiers to attack at one strategic site.
                </li>
                <li>
Area ambushes utilize multiple related point ambushes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
Good ambush sites (areas where an ambush occurs for point ambushes in particular) are defined with the
 characteristics of having protective obstacles, good cover, ease of withdrawal, and clear visage to where
 the enemy will be.
        </li>
        <li>
Ambushes are often composed of a lead and rear-blocking force, a main assault force, observation towers,
 and a command post.

There are four primary types of encirclement/envelopment:
            <ul>
                <li>
Single envelopment / flanking maneuver has one enveloping force striking the enemy’s flank.
                </li>
                <li>
A pincer movement consists of two simultaneous single envelopments.
                </li>
                <li>
Envelopment via pocket occurs when enemy forces are split off and isolated from their main forces.
 Allied forces may opt for a direct attack or block off the enemy supply chain until their forces are
 exhausted and force a surrender.
                </li>
                <li>
Vertical envelopment occurs when air-dropped or air-landed troops attack enemy flank(s), encircling them.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
Unlike other more straight-forward tactics, a successfully pulled off envelopment / encirclement can serve as a
 disrupter in enemy forces even outside of active combat as it focuses not only on destroying enemy forces but
 also crippling their will to fight.

This tactic focuses on breaking enemy coordination between subunits to win many small battles.
        </li>
        <li>
The following methods help facilitate a successful defeat-in-detail: quick attacks that hinder enemy response time,
 targeting an enemy subunit that is more remote from defending units (hence giving little opportunity for
 counterattack), and disrupting the enemy’s communication network.
        </li>

Different types of defenses can be used at each layer to focus on stopping specific kinds of enemies.
 For example, one layer might have wire entanglements to stop foot soldiers, while another might use
 ‘dragon’s teeth’ (small pyramids of reinforced concrete) to stop tanks.
        </li>
        <li>
This tactic is an effective defense against concentrated soldiers, but it may not be a viable strategy
 if valuable resources are close to the front line.
        </li>
        <li>
The concept of multilayered protection used in defense in depth has inspired uses in other fields,
 such as nuclear engineering and information security.

At the beginning of WWI, the German’s used specialized Stoßtruppen (storm troops) to do
 infiltration missions.
        </li>
        <li>
Heavy artillery fire was often used to create weak points, which infiltrating units could exploit.
        </li>

Sun Tzu warned about this tactic in The Art of War: "Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight."
        </li>
        <li>
The Mongols were known to frequently use this tactic, enough that their enemies began to anticipate
 the trap. The Mongols would extend the duration of their retreat for days or even weeks while waiting
 for their pursuers to drop their guards before ultimately pivoting back to attack.
