The ambush tactic has been used since ancient times and still persists in modern-day warfare.
 It was originally thought to be utilized for catching game unaware in hunting. One of the first recorded
 instances of an ambush being utilized was at the “Battle of the Trebia River” in which Carthaginian forces
 used it as a decisive means of hindering and breaking up Roman forces around 218 B.C. Ambush warfare has had
 a strong foothold in ancient tribal battles. This tactic was also used notably in the “Battle of Midway”
 during World War II, in which U.S. forces crippled a Japanese fleet and forced them to retreat while maintaining
 far fewer losses. This tactic has continued to show effectiveness even today.

Variants of this tactic (defined in the “Fun Facts” section) have been used since ancient times. One such
 example is a pincer movement utilized by Hannibal in the Battle of Cannae in 216 B.C. Some other notable
 periods include Alexander the Great’s single envelopment deployment in the Battle of Issus in 333 B.C.,
 and more recently pincers were commonly used by the Germans in World War II to deal with thousands upon thousands
 of troops at once.

This tactic has had roots in many eras of warfare, from ancient times all the way to the modern day.
 Alexander the Great utilized this tactic in the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 B.C. Defeat-in-detail has been present
 in many battles since then such as the Battle of Sluys in 1340 between France and England, and even recently with
 it notably being used in World War II in the Battle of Savo Island which was a naval battle between the Imperial
 Japanese Navy and the Allied forces.

Variations of this tactic have been used for millennia. The first known use was in 216 BC,
 when Hannibal used this strategy to destroy eight roman legions. It has been used extensively
 in more recent wars too, including the American Revolutionary War, World War II, and the
 Vietnam war. It was even a major part of NATO’s planned defense strategy during the cold war. This
 wide range of use is a testament to the tactic’s adaptability.

Infiltration tactics have been used for thousands of years, but their use has been limited for most
 of that time. While useful to weaken enemy forces, they were rarely the determining factor. However,
 these tactics were greatly developed during World War I and II, particularly by the Germans, and
 became a much more central part of warfare. In World War I, German General Hutier gained significant
 ground using infiltration tactics and artillery to confuse the enemy. Despite his initial success,
 his assault outpaced the supply line and came at a high cost in casualties, making it ultimately
 unsustainable. Many of these issues were addressed in World War II by using armored vehicles and
 aircraft to extend the supply line, culminating in what’s now known as Blitzkrieg. In modern militaries,
 concepts of infiltration are part of modern maneuver warfare and thus are part of every soldier’s
 arsenal, rather than limited to specialized units.

Feigned retreats have been a major strategy in war since the earliest stages, with the first
 recorded instance occurring ca. 771–478 BCE. When successful, this tactic can be devastating to the
 enemy, and effectively end the battle. Some famous examples include:
    <ul>
        <li>
The Battle of Hastings in 1066, where William the Conqueror feigned retreat to lure his enemy’s infantry
 from the high ground, leading to their destruction
        </li>
        <li>
The Battle of Kasserine Pass during WWII in 1943, the 21st Panzer division feigned retreat, luring tanks
 of the US 1st Armored division into a screen of anti-tank guns, destroying nearly all of them.
